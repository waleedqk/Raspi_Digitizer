# Expand the FileSystem

    sudo raspi-config

# Change the Default user password

    sudo passwd pi

# Chenge the hostname of the Pi

1) Edit /etc/hosts
2) Edit /etc/hostname
3) Commit Changes 
4) Reboot


## 1) Edit /etc/hosts

At the terminal, type

    sudo nano /etc/hosts

Leave all of the entries alone except for the very last entry labeled 127.0.1.1 with the hostname “raspberrypi“. This is the only line you want to edit. Replace “raspberrypi” with whatever hostname you desire.


## 2) Edit /etc/hostname

At the terminal, type

    sudo nano /etc/hostname

This file only contains your current hostname. Replace the default “raspberrypi” with the same hostname you put in the previous step. 


## 3) Commit Changes

Commit the changes to the system and reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

    sudo /etc/init.d/hostname.sh

## 4) Rebbot

Rebbot the device:

    sudo reboot


# SSH Passwordless Login Using SSH

## 1) Create the .ssh directory on the rasp_pi

    mkdir -p ~/.ssh

## 2) Create a ssh_key from host

Generate a pair of public keys from the host from where you will log into the rasp_pi:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ras_pi

## 3) Upload Generated Public Keys to rasp_pi

Use SSH from server (host) and upload new generated public key on server rasp_pi under pi‘s .ssh directory as a file name authorized_keys.

    cat .ssh/id_ras_pi.pub | ssh pi@raspberry.local 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

or alternatively 

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ras_pi pi@raspberry.local

## 4) Set SSH Permissions on rasp_pi

Due to different SSH versions on servers, we need to set permissions on .ssh directory and authorized_keys file.

    ssh pi@raspberry.local "chmod 700 ~/.ssh; chmod 640 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

## 5) SSH login passwordless

SSH into the rasp_pi without having to provide the password:

    ssh pi@raspberry.local

or if key needs to be specified:

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ras_pi pi@raspberry.local

# Install the dependencies for the system

    sudo bash setup/setup.bash
